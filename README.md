✅ What I Learned

Using useState for state in functional components

Handling click events in React

Basic component structure and styling with CSS

📌 To Improve / Future Ideas

Add input to adjust the “step” by which counter increments/decrements

Prevent decrement going below zero

Add animations for buttons

Persist count in localStorage so value remains on refresh
